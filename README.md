  <h1 align="Center">Bixby One-Step Transactions and OAuth Sample</h1>
</p>

## Overview

This capsule enables users to perform basic banking transactions, such as money transfers. The capsule showcases the implementation of simple one-step transactions and OAuth authentication.

To utilize this capsule, you must set up a server-side component to serve as the OAuth provider. Refer to the [viv-bank-server](/viv-bank-server/) directory for this purpose and follow the instructions provided in the [README](/viv-bank-server/README.md). Please note that you will need to modify the capsule's code and configuration to align with the settings configured in the server-side component.
